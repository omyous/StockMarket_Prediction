Amazon’s business model (supply chain - hub/spoke) necessitates building fulfillment centers in “red” states.

I expressed my concerns about Google’s potential for picking winners and losers in search algorithms. Watch: Would you pay a monthly fee to Google to change the search results? Advertising $and search results ranking let you use Google free. We need to get real - tech companies aren’t a public service. Something has to pay engineers’ salaries. So *of course* they favor big business! It is but its not illegal and they employ thousands of people here. I recently spoke with a senior in a tech firm who said they can take their business to any number of countries. Broadband for all good.

So 5G support &amp; interface will become a necessity, I believe. Which argument? Google pay their due taxes. When corp tax was reduced to 20% in 2015 the corp tax take went up. So why would you want to introduce a 'Google Tax', what message would that send to tech firms who have great flexibility in where they locate their business . The wind is ’s favor.

Let us also remember that even Amazon, Google and Microsoft rely on government business, and it is the govt. (not private business) that should get their house in order.

They ended up skinning that and a CRM system with Flash and leaving it in place vs. making a change. Business continuity probably drove that decision. Couldn’t disrupt a lean business.

I know a lot of places who installed SAP, found they weren't eg one of the 5 types of bakery that SAP believes exist and customised SAP so it understood their business and then discovered that meant any upgrade meant doing all that work over again so never upgraded They need to go far deeper than that. They need to have intimate business knowledge and be able to speak in terms that resonate with the customer they are selling to. #cloud #CIO Personally, I like the @sapcp #cloud strategy: Pick hyperscaler of your choice to run. They stay out of the bruising commodity cloud business + let you deploy their differentiating higher order business/IT #apps + platforms on any cloud. They get to ride in everyone's growth car. Key success factor for next gen of cloud vendors is ability to move existing enterprise software offering to cloud, such as Microsoft moving Office to cloud and using that as a hook to win Enterprise Azure business. Not clear Cisco has a path to do that.

Of course, supply chain for Apple will matter but for Google/Facebook/Netflix you can still access at home... maybe even more often! Same for business software... From a business perspective, #cloud is delivering on the desire to move IT from CAPEX to OPEX. Most companies start with the expectation of cost savings and end up rather disappointed. Bad sales of bad planning? I believe ‘blackbox thinking’ in many orgs is a root cause! Cloud is mainly a business model change and it can increase utilization/density for most (not all) workloads! It stops zig-zag of infrastructure procurement... Move to cloud 2.0, you get compute on wire (#serverless) along with #DataScience platforms with hyper-pace innovation! A top Oracle exec says Google is virtually alone in its Supreme Court battle over Java, downplayin (Benjamin Pimentel/Business Insider: Tech) http://dlvr.it/RQCtHk I hear all the time cloud isn't cheaper though. @tcrawford and @CTOAdvisor trumpet this a lot. I would agree no one is getting the same economies of scale but this is still a business for them. How much savings is passed on to the consumer? How much is run away profits? And where's the value added? It's rarely in running commodity operating systems and other tooling. It's almost always in business logic, line of business tools, and the things that are differentiators. For many (but not all!) of us, that means cloud makes sense for many workloads Technically speaking, all that’s being done in cloud can be done in your data centers; logistically and economically — it can be suicidal, unless you are a CSP!

The only thing asked is that DMCA Section 230 special protections for big tech get removed. If they're ""just a private business,"" let them act that way without privileges. Republican or Democrat alike, if you are selling out the American people you gotta go. It’s time for voters to take care of business Tucker Carlson absolutely pummels big tech platform Google and hammers the politicians who give them and others cover GOP and DNC do little but whine about big tech censorship,because they are beholden to big business money. They don’t like censorship, but they prefer money.Fact is,Google, Facebook, and Amazon should be broken up into smaller companies and regulated, and S230 deleted. @gop @DNC  The Top 50 Most Innovative Products (Part One) #Innovation #Business #Technology #HealthTech #HomeTech #InsurTech #Fintech #Banking #Enterprise #Insurance #Payments #Defstar5 #PaaS #IaaS #SaaS #Microsoft #Google #Oracle #SalesForce #Cloud #Tech @JoeDanMedia Congratulations on the 8 years and good for you...GOOGLE is in everyone's business! It sucks. I'm sick of big tech being SO BIASED! ! Too early for either. High tech manufacturing in the US will be way too expensive until fabricators can go almost fully automated. That's a good 10 years away still. Google isn't going anywhere not while the metadata it supplies to business and government continues to have value Lee is as sorry a human being as Romney. He works for Google &amp; big tech who built facilities in Utah because he promised them foreign workers. He constantly tries to push his bill through unchallenged similar to how nasty paulsy Nancy does business. Utah must be full of idiots. The Federalist is trash and probably objectively deserves to get run off of Google's revenue platform... but once again, I remind everyone that every Google tech/office employee I have ever met was a category 5 asshole. If you don't like their business practices, consider that. What do you think Google, Facebook, Twitter, all the news, media, TV shows, etc is? Have you watched a movie? Product placement. Have you watched a single sporting event? Product placement LITERALLY EVERYWHERE. Wake up. That's HOW business works now."

Monopolies like Fb, Twitter, and Google are crossing lines on censorship in order to back Congress into a corner to regulate big tech.
